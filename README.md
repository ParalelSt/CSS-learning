In this project I focused on making a simple E commerce website copy of a site I found most likely on awwwards.com.
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript for it, this project was more of a refresher on CSS rather than learning as the name states.
It was one of my attempts at creating responsive design of a site which didn't really have a great responsive design to begin with
